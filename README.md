# LeoCore OS

**LeoCore OS** is a futuristic, AI-native operating system designed to redefine how humans interact with technology. It integrates advanced artificial intelligence at the core, enabling self-healing, adaptive, and predictive behavior across all layers of the OS. LeoCore OS is modular, secure, privacy-first, and future-ready, making it a step ahead of traditional operating systems like Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Phase 1

Phase 1 delivers a minimal, GRUB-bootable kernel (C with future Rust modules), skeletons for AI and UI engines, scripts to build and run via QEMU, and docs outlining the vision and roadmap.

### Build

```
make            # builds kernel and ISO (if grub-mkrescue is installed)
```

### Run & Test

```
make run                # run with window
make nographic          # headless (CI-friendly)
make debug              # QEMU with -s -S for GDB
```

If ISO creation is unavailable, you can run directly:

```
qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel core/kernel/kernel.elf -serial stdio
```

### Requirements

- x86_64-elf-gcc, x86_64-elf-ld
- qemu-system-x86_64
- grub-mkrescue (recommended) or GRUB toolchain with xorriso
